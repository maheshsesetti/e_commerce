# How to Push Your E-Commerce Project to GitHub

## Prerequisites
1. **Install Git** (if not already installed):
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Follow the installation wizard

2. **Create a GitHub Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to: https://github.com
   - Sign up for a free account

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in your project directory and run:
```bash
git init
```

### Step 2: Add Your Files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Make Your First Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: E-commerce backend API with authentication, products, orders, and payments"
```

### Step 4: Create a New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name it: `e-commerce-backend-api`
5. Description: `A complete Node.js backend for an e-commerce platform`
6. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 5: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-commerce-backend-api.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

### Step 6: Verify
Go to your GitHub repository URL to see your code uploaded!

## Project Structure
Your repository will contain:
- ✅ Complete e-commerce backend API
- ✅ User authentication with JWT
- ✅ Product management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ Order processing
- ✅ Payment integration (mock)
- ✅ Comprehensive API documentation
- ✅ Proper .gitignore file
- ✅ Detailed README.md

## Next Steps
1. **Add Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file locally (not in Git)
2. **Set up MongoDB**: Connect to your database
3. **Deploy**: Consider deploying to platforms like Heroku, Railway, or Vercel
4. **Add Features**: Implement real payment gateways, email notifications, etc.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get authentication errors, you may need to set up SSH keys or use GitHub CLI
- If Git commands aren't recognized, restart your terminal after installing Git
- Make sure you're in the correct directory when running commands
